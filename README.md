**A Sample CodeIgniter 4 web application created with [CodeIgniter Wizard](https://www.ozar.net) using the responsive Bootstrap4-based AdminLTE v3 template**

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. 
More information can be found at the [official site](https://codeigniter.com).

## What is CodeIgniter Wizard?

CodeIgniter Wizard is a Rapid Application Development utility which helps quickly generate an advanced starting point for MySQL/MariaDB database-driven web applications with administrative interfaces.

With a database-first approach, the wizard asks you to select the tables and fields you want to include in your application, and then it automatically generates the necessary models, views and controllers - even the new CodeIgniter 4 entities, supporting standard database CRUD operations namely create, read, update and delete. It even creates a sidebar and (dashboard) home pages automatically with some basic data from your modules.
More information can be found at the [official site of CodeIgniter Wizard](https://www.ozar.net/products/codeigniterwizard/).
